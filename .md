class distutils.core.Extension
The Extension class describes a single C or C++ extension module in a setup script. It accepts the following keyword arguments in its constructor:

|argument name|value|type|
|name|the full name of the extension, including any packages — ie. not a filename or pathname, but Python dotted name|a string|

sources

list of source filenames, relative to the distribution root (where the setup script lives), in Unix form (slash-separated) for portability. Source files may be C, C++, SWIG (.i), platform-specific resource files, or whatever else is recognized by the build_ext command as source for a Python extension.

a list of strings

include_dirs

list of directories to search for C/C++ header files (in Unix form for portability)

a list of strings

define_macros

list of macros to define; each macro is defined using a 2-tuple (name, value), where value is either the string to define it to or None to define it without a particular value (equivalent of #define FOO in source or -DFOO on Unix C compiler command line)

a list of tuples

undef_macros

list of macros to undefine explicitly

a list of strings

library_dirs

list of directories to search for C/C++ libraries at link time

a list of strings

libraries

list of library names (not filenames or paths) to link against

a list of strings

runtime_library_dirs

list of directories to search for C/C++ libraries at run time (for shared extensions, this is when the extension is loaded)

a list of strings

extra_objects

list of extra files to link with (eg. object files not implied by ‘sources’, static library that must be explicitly specified, binary resource files, etc.)

a list of strings

extra_compile_args

any extra platform- and compiler-specific information to use when compiling the source files in ‘sources’. For platforms and compilers where a command line makes sense, this is typically a list of command-line arguments, but for other platforms it could be anything.

a list of strings

extra_link_args

any extra platform- and compiler-specific information to use when linking object files together to create the extension (or to create a new static Python interpreter). Similar interpretation as for ‘extra_compile_args’.

a list of strings

export_symbols

list of symbols to be exported from a shared extension. Not used on all platforms, and not generally necessary for Python extensions, which typically export exactly one symbol: init + extension_name.

a list of strings

depends

list of files that the extension depends on

a list of strings

language

extension language (i.e. 'c', 'c++', 'objc'). Will be detected from the source extensions if not provided.

a string

optional

specifies that a build failure in the extension should not abort the build process, but simply skip the extension.

a boolean

Changed in version 3.8: On Unix, C extensions are no longer linked to libpython except on Android and Cygwin.
